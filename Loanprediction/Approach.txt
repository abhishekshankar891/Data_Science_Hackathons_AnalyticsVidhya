1.Replaced missing value with -999 in both train and test files as there were many columns with missing data,dropping would result in missing large chunk of dataset,hence imputed with -999
2.CODE_GENDER column contained XNA as values ,replaced with -999
3.DAYS_BIRTH column contained negative value,it was replaced with Age column upon converting to years
4.Derived features were added to important features identified using the algorithm (Lightgradient Boosting).Like 
credittoAnnuityratio=AMT_CREDIT/AMT_ANNUITY,credittogoodsprice=AMT_CREDIT/AMT_GOODS_PRICE
5.NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE column showed ordinality hence encoded accordingly.
6.Original columns were dropped keeping the derived ones.
7.DAYS_EMPLOYED contained 365243 as an ambigous value which was replaced with -999 in both train and test.
